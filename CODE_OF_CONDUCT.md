# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

Version 2.1, September 16th, 2019

## Our Pledge
In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Showing empathy toward other community members
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing other people's private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at contact@noxion.dev. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

Project maintainers will respond in a timely manner. This policy can be updated as necessary to reflect community feedback.
